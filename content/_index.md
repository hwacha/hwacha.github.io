# Bill Marcy

### Software Engineer

#### [Resume](bill-marcy-resume.pdf)

I studied computer science at Brown University alongside a concentration in philosophy. After that, I worked at the CUNY Research Foundation for three years, at first as a front-end developer and later as a UX engineer. After CUNY, I've focused on learning more about web development from the ground up. Lately, I've been putting those efforts into Playtree, a web app which lets a user make Spotify song collections where playback can loop and branch.

All the while, I've also worked on personal game projects like Entale, an open-world RPG with a procedural language system. I also attended the Recurse Center, a programming retreat, where I experimented with computer graphics, React development, and logic programming.
