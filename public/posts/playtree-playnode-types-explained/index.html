    <h1>Playtree Playnode Types Explained</h1>
    
    <article>
      <p>Up to this point, playnodes have contained a single song. In practice, though, it would be tedious to have to make a playnode and playedges for every single song you want in a playtree. The playnodes in the Playtree app are containers for any number of songs. Because playnodes can handle collections of songs, it opens the possibility of adding whole playlists into a playnode.</p>
<p>Playnodes come in two types: <strong>sequencers</strong> and <strong>selectors</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sequencer-playnodes">Sequencer playnodes</h3>
<p>A sequencer takes each of its songs and plays them all in order before passing playback to a playedge.</p>
<p><img src="sequencer-playnode.png" alt="medium"></p>
<p>This is a sequencer playnode, designated with the number icon and the green color. It plays &ldquo;Spring,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Summer,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Autumn Leaves,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Winter Wonderland,&rdquo; and then playback moves to one of its outgoing playedges.</p>
<p>Here, you&rsquo;ll see that the playnode&rsquo;s limit is set to <code>-1</code>. This means that the playnode doesn&rsquo;t have a limit on the number of times it can play. You might also notice the repeat parameter to the left of the limit. A repeat value of <code>3</code>, for example, will repeat the season sequence three times before passing playback.</p>
<h3 id="selector-playnodes">Selector playnodes</h3>
<p>A selector will randomly select one of its songs to play and, after one song, pass playback to its outgoing playedges.</p>
<p><img src="selector-playnode.png" alt="medium"></p>
<p>A selector playnode has a die icon and an orange color. It will select one song from &ldquo;Spring,&rdquo; &ldquo;Summer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Autumn Leaves,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Winter Wonderland,&rdquo; play it, and then pass playback.</p>
<p>Note that the selector playnode is not a &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo;; the chances of selecting a song that just played are just as good the next time around. You can <em>construct</em> shuffle behavior from a selector with repeats and limits, but that behavior emerges from interacting features.</p>
<h3 id="playnode-types-as-shorthand">Playnode types as shorthand</h3>
<p>You can think of sequencers and selectors as shorthand for subgraphs. If we go back to our original &ldquo;One Song Per Node&rdquo; diagram format, you can think of the sequencer playnode as having this underlying structure:</p>
<p><img src="sequencer-subgraph.png" alt="small"></p>
<p>Alternatively, the selector playnode has this underlying structure:</p>
<p><img src="selector-subgraph.png" alt="medium"></p>
<p>Treat &ldquo;[entry point]&rdquo; and &ldquo;[exit point]&rdquo; as zero-song nodes that reduce the number of edges needed for illustration.</p>
<p>(Note that the underlying subgraphs that would accurately correspond to all of each playnodes&rsquo; behaviors are slightly more complicated, but those extra details are omitted here for the sake of clarity. These analogies are basically right, for our purposes.)</p>
<h3 id="playnode-parameters">Playnode parameters</h3>
<p>The playnodes don&rsquo;t just have limit parameters. The individual songs in a playnode do, too. In a sequencer, playback will skip over a limited song. This is analogous to the playback behavior of a limited playnode. In a selector, a limited song won&rsquo;t be selected. This is analogous to limiting a playnode&rsquo;s incoming edge.</p>
<p>You can imagine setting a song&rsquo;s <code>mult</code> or <em>multiplier</em> parameter to the value <code>n</code> as creating <code>n</code> copies of the song in the playnode. In a sequencer, this amounts to repeating the song <code>n</code> times. In a selector, it amounts to weighting the likelihood of choosing the song, like setting the shares value on an incoming edge.</p>
<p>The <code>deg</code> (in older versions, &ldquo;exp&rdquo;) or <em>degree</em> parameter is related to priority. In a selector, setting a song&rsquo;s degree is like setting the priority value on an incoming edge: only available songs with the lowest degree will be selected to play. In a sequencer, playback will play each song of the lowest degree, in order, while skipping over the songs of higher degree. If a song is limited, its degree is no longer considered.</p>
<p>The math underlying a sequencer&rsquo;s degree behavior is less intuitive than the math underlying a selector&rsquo;s, which is just the priority concept. This is the formula, but feel free to skip it if it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. Let \(S\) be the set of songs in a sequencer, and \(A \subseteq S\) is the set of &ldquo;available&rdquo; songs in the sequencer that are not limited or set to <code>0</code> mult. Let \(D_A\) be the set of unique degree values in \(A\). Then the number of times a song \(s_i\) plays in the sequencer when playback reaches index \(i\) is given by</p>
\[
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{mult_{s_i} * x^{deg_{s_i}}}{\sum\limits_{d \in D_A} x^{d}}.
\end{align}
\]<p>This limit evaluates to \(0\) when a song doesn&rsquo;t have the lowest degree, and evaluates to its <code>mult</code> value when it <em>does</em> have the lowest degree. Remember that you should treat a limited song&rsquo;s <code>mult</code> value as <code>0</code>.</p>
